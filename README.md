This file contains all required information relevant to my graduate diploma thesis titled “Localization of Neighboring Genes in the Manifestation of Pathological Conditions from Large Gene Expression Data Sets”. The purpose of this theis was the correlation between gene positions and expression an effect refered to as transcription wave. All expression data have been originate from the recount2 database built by Collado-Torres, Leonardo, et al. and presented intheir paper “Reproducible RNA-Seq Analysis Using Recount2.” Nature Biotechnology, vol. 35, no. 4, 1 Apr. 2017, pp. 319–321, whereas all genomic cordinates from ensembl.
